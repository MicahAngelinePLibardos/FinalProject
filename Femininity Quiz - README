How the Quiz Works:
  The quiz consists of five multiple-choice questions, each with four answer options. Users must select an answer before proceeding to the next question. The quiz provides visual feedback by highlighting:
    - Green for correct answers
    - Red for incorrect answers
At the end of the quiz, the user receives a final score out of five.


Features:
  Interactive Questions: Users answer one question at a time before moving forward.
  Answer Validation: The quiz ensures users select an option before proceeding.
  Color Indicators: Correct and incorrect answers are visually highlighted.
  Navigation Buttons:
      - "Next" to move forward after selecting an answer.
      - "Previous" to go back to a previous question.
      - "Submit" to view the final score at the end.
  Modular JavaScript Code:
      - Uses functions to manage quiz logic.
      - Implements event handlers for user interactions.
      - Controls quiz flow with if-else statements and loops.


Integration:
The quiz is embedded within the Femininity SDG Website, specifically on a dedicated quiz section. It is structured using:
  HTML for quiz layout.
  CSS for styling and responsiveness.
  JavaScript (external file: script.js) for quiz functionality.
