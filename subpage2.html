            Femininity refers to qualities, behaviors, and roles that are associated with women, such as empathy, grace, and sensitivity. It is often related to how society expects women to act, dress, and behave. However, femininity isn't limited to one gender, everyone can express these qualities in their own unique way. It is important to recognize that femininity can be shown by anyone, regardless of gender.

            Itâ€™s okay for both men and women to show femininity because expressing emotions, being caring, or appreciating beauty are human traits. Men can also be feminine by embracing qualities like gentleness, emotional expression, and kindness without being judged. Society is slowly moving toward understanding that masculinity and femininity are not opposites, and both can coexist in anyone, allowing people to be true to themselves without fear of societal expectations.
